Terminal::Tests - Terminal emulator and font quality and correctness tests

$ terminal-test
# ... multi-page survey-style test ...

=end code


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Terminal::Tests is a collection of quality and correctness tests for terminal
emulators, terminal multiplexers, Unicode configurations, and monospace fonts.

The simple C<terminal-quick-test> program displays a simple test pattern that
should fit in a default 80x24 terminal window, and will catch some of the most
common terminal configuration problems.  For a more nuanced test, try the full
C<terminal-test> program, which shows numerous test patterns and describes what
you should expect to see in each.


=head2 Quick Test Pattern

To display the quick test program, simply run C<terminal-quick-test>; you can
add the C<--ruler> option if you'd like to also display a screen width ruler
to help detect misalignment.  I<Correct> output should be no more than 79
columns on any line, so you've likely run into a terminal bug if the displayed
test pattern is wider than that.

At the time of writing, I've not yet seen any terminals show a perfect test
pattern; the best results so far get everything except the emoji row correct.
For reference, here's what the pattern looks like on a default
C<gnome-terminal> in Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or Linux Mint 21.x (based on that same
Ubuntu LTS release):

The rightmost block of emoji should have skin tones applied, rather than shown
in fallback mode as a tone swatch next to a yellow emoji, causing the line to
overflow.  Windows Terminal in Windows 10 similarly gets most of the pattern
correct, but again fails on the emoji row:

L<Screenshot of quick test on Windows Terminal in UTF-8 mode|docs/images/quick-test-windows-terminal-utf8.png>

Here it applies skin tones to the rightmost set, but still leaves extra room
where the tone swatch I<would> be, thus once again causing the line to wrap --
and this time also failing on the leftmost set of emoji faces, which should
display in text outline mode as seen in the screenshot for C<gnome-terminal>.

However, Windows Terminal will only do that well under Windows 10 if "beta"
UTF-8 support is turned on (see separate L<#Windows 10> section below).  Without
that, the test pattern will fall apart:

Some failures are more subtle, affecting only one feature.  Here's an example
of the pattern as seen inside of GNU Screen in a C<gnome-terminal>:

The degradation here is that Gnu Screen supports 4-bit and 8-bit ANSI color,
but not 24-bit ANSI color, so the red/green/blue bars are missing.

Finally, some problems are merely configuration or option issues.  Here's xterm
in its default configuration on my system, using the low-res (but at least
Unicode-capable) B<bitmap> "fixed" font, launched with just C<xterm>:

L<Screenshot of quick test running on xterm using the Unicode fixed font|docs/images/quick-test-xterm-fixed-unicode.png>

Many of the symbols are nearly unreadable, and emoji aren't supported at all.
Even worse, specifying a larger bitmap font size defaults to using the
I<non-Unicode> version of the font, here launched with C<xterm -fn 10x20>:

Using a scalable font will work better, even at the default small size, but
emoji are still completely unsupported; here I've just told C<xterm> to use the
default system monospace scalable font using C<xterm -fa mono>:

L<Screenshot of quick test running on xterm using the mono scalable font|docs/images/quick-test-xterm-mono.png>

Scaling this up works better unsurprisingly (using C<xterm -fa mono -fs 12>):

=head2 Full Terminal Test

The C<terminal-test> program includes a far more complete set of test patterns
across a range of categories, including descriptions of what you should expect
to see in each pattern, as well as common artifacts that you should ideally
I<not> see.  You can rate the display of each pattern on a simple scale, and
the program will summarize the results in text or JSON (with the C<--json>
option) after you have rated the last test pattern.


=head2 Terminal-Specific Tweaks

=head3 Windows 10

By default Windows Terminal under Windows 10 supports only UTF-16, an old
Unicode encoding that has otherwise been replaced by the UTF-8 encoding.
To fix this, you'll need to follow the instructions in the
L<Enable UTF-8 in Windows Terminal|https://gist.github.com/sapeurfaire/91fe247cd9523971b8fab72d50df6c2a>
